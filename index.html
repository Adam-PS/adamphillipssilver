		<p>I want to make simple, thoughtful, emotive, and beautiful web experiences.  To that end I am learning web development skills in my free time while working as a tech professional in service management and operations.</p>  
		<p>I live in Philadelphia, Pa with my wife Jana and dog Smoula.  We spend our time together wandering the city, hiking, cooking, and playing board games.</p>
