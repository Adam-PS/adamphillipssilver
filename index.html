  <P>I want to make simple, thoughtful, emotive, and beautiful web experiences.  I work as a tech professional in service management and operations and I am learning web development skills in my free time.  I live in Philadelphia, Pa with my wife Jana and dog Smoula.  We spend our time together wandering the city, hiking, cooking, and playing board games.  Feel free to use the links to the left to find more about my professional experience and contact me.</P>
